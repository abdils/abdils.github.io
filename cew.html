    <h2>Charlie Eats Worms</h2>
    
    <p>Charlie Eats Worms is a touch screen game that I designed off of another game called Monster Wants Candy.  This was a project from the Digital Corps where I had to work with a team of 2 developers, and another designer.  I was responsible for designing all the interfaces, buttons, colors, the worms, and the skin for the backgrounds.  Each of the worms are based off of the college MAC teams that Ball State University plays against.  This game was inteded to be a fun way for students to build some school spirit while having a good time.
