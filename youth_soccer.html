    <h2>Youth Soccer Camp Simulation</h2>
    
    <p>This is virtual simulation assignment for a summer course at Ball State University.  The simulation replicates the organizational skills required to organize a youth soccer camp. The users will pre-plan activities, order materials and personnel from suppliers, and also drag and drop them onto the illustrated soccer fields.  Users will also need to be able to adapt to situations such as incoming rain, short staffed personnel, player injuries and medical emergencies, etc. I was the lead designer on this project and worked with 2 developers to build this for a client through the Digital Corps.
