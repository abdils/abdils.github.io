    <div class="about">
    <p> I'm a designer, an artist, a photographer, a glass blower, pizza eater, coffee drinker, thrill seeker, and nature lover. Over the past few years I've worked in a very hands-on collaborative work environment, that has allowed me to sharpen my skills as a designer. The Digital Corps has helped me establish efficent routines, constructive habits, and tricks to stay productive and connected to a distributed team. I have designed websites, logos, icons, wireframes, touch screen games, branding campaigns, promotional materials and much more. In May of 2016 I will be a recent gradute of Ball State University, School of Art. While earning my BFA, I have learned the value of making conceptually driven work that has been displayed in shows around the country. The Ball State School of Art has developed my technical skill sets, and has also provided me a solid fine arts background.
