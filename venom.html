    <h2>Venom Medicine</h2>
    
    <p>For this project I designed all of the labels and illustrations for the bottles which were found objects. Venom Medicine was inspired by Bill Haast, a previous director of the Miami Serpentarium Laboratories, a facility  that produces snake venom for medical and research use.  Bill Haast is known for studying a very unique style of medicine which consisted of him injecting himself with snake venom.  I found Bill Haast's research to be fascinating and began to do further research as to why and how he became involved with this ancient medicine.  I wanted to combine the aesthetic of vintage medicine bottles, with unique designed labels depicting snake venom oils.
