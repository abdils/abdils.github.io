    <h2>Venom Medicine</h2>
    
    <p>Venom Medicine was inspired by Bill Haast, a previous director of the Miami Serpentarium Laboratories, a facility  that produces snake venom for medical and research use.  Bill Haast is known for studying a very unique style of medicine which consisted of him injecting himself with snake venom.  I found Bill Haast's research to be fascinating and began to do further research as to why and how he became involved with this ancient medicine.  Thus the spark of insiration to make this project.  I wanted to hybridze the idea of vintage medicine bottles , with individually designed labels depicting snake venom oils.
